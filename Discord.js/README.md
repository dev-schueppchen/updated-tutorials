## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

#### 1. Create the project and install all dependencies
Open your terminal in the folder you want to store the bot in.
``` BASH
# Check if Node is installed
node --version
# Create a Node project and type in whatever you want but make sure your main file is main.js
npm init
# Create main.js file
touch main.js
# install discord.js
npm install discord.js
```
#### 2. Create a config.json
Now create a config.json and use this template:
```
{
    "token": "YOUR-TOKEN-GOES-HERE",
    "prefix": "::"
}
```
Now get your token from [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) and put it in your config.json.  

if you have everything done right your folder should look like this:
```
|
|
|__ node_modules
|__ config.json
|__ main.js
|__ package-lock.json
|__ package.json
```
